# Migration file for creating "program" nodes from CSV.
#
# This file contains much of the information which we
# used to specify in the "Migration" class in Drupal 7.
# But why write code if you can write YAML?
# This is how we declare a Migration the Drupal 8 way.

# Migration ID.
#
# Usually the ID indicates what we are trying to migrate.
# In our case, we are migrating nodes of type "program".
id: program_data
# Human-readable name of the migration for the UI.
label: Academic programs and associated data.
# Migration group.
#
# Migration groups allow us to put related migrations under one
# umbrella so that we can execute or reference them together.
migration_group: c11n
# Migration tags.
#
# Migration tags help us group migrations using tags. In our
# example, we tag all migrations with an "academic program"
# tag. That way, we can run all academic-program-related migrations
# using one command.
migration_tags:
  - node
  - academic program
# Source.
#
# Under the source, we define the key "plugin" and other
# configurations specific to the plugin.
source:
  # We will be importing from a CSV file, so we will require
  # the migrate_source_csv module which introduces the CSV
  # source plugin with the identifier "csv".
  plugin: csv
  # Specify the path to the CSV data source.
  path: 'public://import/program/program.data.csv'
  # Number of rows at the beginning which are not actual data.
  header_row_count: 1
  # Unique ID.
  #
  # These are the column names from the CSV file representing the
  # unique identifier for each source record. These will be used
  # by the Migration API to relate source records to migrated
  # entities usually for an updating imported records or for performing
  # rollbacks.
  keys:
    - ID
  # Definitions for fields available in the source.
  #
  # This is an optional configuration but it makes the UI more
  # explanatory. It is a set of key-value pairs where the key
  # is the property name and the value is a string describing what
  # the property is all about.
  fields:
    ID: Unique identifier for the program as in the data source.
    Title: Name of the program.
    Body: A description for the program.
    Level: Whether the program is for undergraduates or graduates.
    Type: Whether it is a full-time or a part-time program.
    Image file: Name of the image file associated with the program.
    Image alt: Alternate text for the image for accessibilty.
    Tags: Comma-separated strings to use as tags.
    Fees: We will ignore this field as per requirement.
  # Static values for the migration.
  #
  # We can assign hard-coded values to certain properties using constants.
  constants:
    bool_0: 0
    bool_1: 1
    uid_root: 1
    restricted_html: restricted_html
# Destination.
destination:
  # We want to import data from a CSV file, but how do we save it?
  # This plugin will be responsible for storing the records read during
  # the migration in to nodes. We can also store them as other entities
  # like taxonomy terms, etc. But in this case we want nodes.
  plugin: 'entity:node'
  # We specify the default node type as "program" because
  # we will only be importing nodes of type "program" in this
  # migration.
  default_bundle: program
# Mapping.
#
# We can create simple mappings without any changes to
# source data or we can pass the source data through one or more
# plugins before the processed value is assigned to the
# destination.
process:
  # Here, we make a direct assignment of the "Title" column
  # as the node title. Not specifying a plugin name results in
  # the usage of the plugin "get" which simply copies the source
  # property value to the destination property.
  title: Title
  # There are certain destination fields which do not have
  # corresponding source fields. for these, we defined constants
  # in the "source" parameter. We can refer to them here as
  # "constants/NAME".
  #
  # The below segnment makes the imported "program" nodes non-sticky.
  sticky: 'constants/bool_0'
  # Similarly, we can define a default user for the imported nodes.
  uid: 'constants/uid_root'
  # Some fields have multiple properties! For example, the "body" field
  # can have the actual full text, a summary, etc. Values can be
  # assigned to specific properties using the syntax used below. We
  # wrap the destination property name in quotes to comply with YAML
  # specifications.
  #
  # Unfortunately, at the time of writing this code, there is no UI or
  # drush migrate-fields-destination. Hence, one might have to refer
  # to the structure of various field-types for determining the properties
  # supported by various fields.
  #
  # Reference: https://www.drupal.org/node/2630732
  'body/value': Body
  # We copied the text into the _value_ for the _body_ field, however,
  # we did not specify how the text is to be treated. We do that by
  # specifying the _format_ property of the _body_ field.
  #
  # In the line below we tell Drupal to treat the _body_ as full HTML.
  # Since this value does not come from the data source, we use a constant
  # value defined in "source".
  'body/format': 'constants/restricted_html'
  # For the "Level" of the program, the source has possible values
  # "Graduate" or "Undergraduate". However, in the field definition,
  # we accept only the values "gr" for graduate and "ug" for
  # undergraduate.
  #
  # To transform the value, we can pass it through a series of
  # plugins to transform the source value to the destination value.
  field_program_level:
    # The first plugin we will use will be the "callable" plugin.
    # It will simply send in the source value "Level" to the "strtolower"
    # function to get rid of any upper-case characters in the source.
    # We do this because one of the records says "Undergraduate" while
    # there is another one says "UnderGraduate", which is weird. So, we
    # standardize the values using the "strtolower" function on them.
    #
    # Unfortunately, the callback plugin does not accept any additional
    # arguments for the callback, but in our case we don't need them any way.
    -
      plugin: callback
      callable: strtolower
      source: Level
    # Once transformed to lower-case, we would like to transform the old
    # value in to a new one. This switch-case kind of an operation can
    # be handled by the plugin "static_map" which helps us map existing
    # values to new values (and more).
    -
      plugin: static_map
      map:
        graduate: gr
        undergraduate: ug
  # For the "Type" of the program, though we could use a text-list field,
  # we have set up a taxonomy term reference field. Assuming the vocabulary
  # exists and we have the names of the terms in the data source (CSV), we
  # would need to convert the terms into IDs for use during the migration.
  #
  # Here, we refer to a custom callback which checks if the term exists. If
  # the term exists, the callback returns the ID of the existing term,
  # otherwise, the callback creates the term and returns the ID of the newly
  # created term. Thus, all terms are imported in the process without much
  # hassle.
  #
  # This approach of importing comma-separated taxonomy terms can also be
  # used with multiple terms, though we might have to add additional callbacks
  # or modify our callback for handling splitting of values and converting
  # each term name into an ID.
  field_program_type:
    plugin: callback
    callable: _c11n_migrate_process_program_type
    source: Type
  # For the "Tags" of the program, we need to associate taxonomy terms (tags)
  # generated during the migration "term_tags". For this, we import all tags
  # using the "term_tags" migration in migrate_plus.migration.term_tags.yml.
  field_tags:
    # First we convert the multiple tag values into an array of tag names
    # using the explode plugin which simply explodes/splits a string by a given
    # delimiter. In our case, we split the text by ", " to get rid of the
    # spaces after the commas at once.
    -
      plugin: explode
      delimiter: ', '
      source: Tags
    # Once the tag names are converted to arrays, we pass the term names
    # through the "migration" plugin. This easy-to-use plugin does the grand
    # task of looking up the terms we imported during the "term_tags"
    # migration and utilizes the IDs of those terms during this migration.
    #
    # To make things better, it can handle multiple values, so each term
    # name gets converted into it's relevant ID. Cool!
    #
    # The migration plugin can be used when the related entities (like tags)
    # are available in a separate data source so that they can be imported
    # first. If they are not available or cannot be extracted to their own
    # data source for the migration, one would have to write their own
    # "process" plugin to explode the terms and translate the term names into
    # their corresponding term IDs.
    -
      plugin: migration
      migration: program_tags
  # For the "Image" of the program, we need to do some real work.
  # First, we need to define the "program_image" migration to generate
  # entities of type "file" for each of the images we wish to use with
  # the programs. Once done, we use the plugin "migration" just like we
  # did above for "tags" and associate the file IDs to the "target_id"
  # property of the "field_image".
  #
  # NOTE: It's so cool that the property is no longer "fid" because D8
  # associates the files as entity references, thereby standardizing
  # things to a great extent.
  'field_image/target_id':
    plugin: migration
    migration: program_image
    source: Image file
  # Now that we have the images in place, we also copy the alternate text
  # for the images to the "alt" property of "field_image". Having "alt"
  # would help improve accessibility and SEO.
  'field_image/alt': Image alt
# With the migration_dependencies, as the name suggests, we can specify
# if this migration requires some other migrations to be run first.
#
# For example, say we were importing articles and authors. In the migration
# of articles, we would need to refer to the newly migrated author data so
# as to link the author to the article. In that case, the article migration
# would require that the author migration be run first. Thus, we could say
# that the article migration depends on the author migration and we would have
# had to specify a dependency here.
#
# In our case, we need to import tags first so that we can associate them
# to the academic programs.
migration_dependencies:
  optional:
    - program_tags
    - program_image
# We specify that this migration depends on the c11n_migrate module.
# Based on this dependency, this migration will be removed when the
# c11n_migrate module is uninstalled.
dependencies:
  enforced:
    module:
      - c11n_migrate
